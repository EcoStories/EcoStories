                    <div class="purple-card-details">The data used on EcoStories is from the website of the US GHG Center and information from NASA to respond to climate change, in this case, to warmer temperatures due to toxic gas emissions. The continued release of carbon dioxide and methane by human activity is directly related to the increase in global temperatures, worsening the climate crisis and putting ecosystems and societies at risk. In Ecostories you can analyze by region the countries whose emissions have high limits. In addition to educating society with this information, it serves as an alert for organizations interested in the study of climate sustainability and contribute to the development of SDG 13: "Take urgent measures to confront climate change and its consequences.</div>

                    <div class="purple-card-details">Our aim is to raise awareness and educate people about the current levels of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which are the main drivers of climate change. Through an interactive and dynamic space, we offer an immersive visual experience that, using dynamic graphics by region, allows users to intuitively explore the impact of these gases on the atmosphere and their relationship with global warming.</div>

                    <div class="purple-card-details">Our mission is to encourage reflection and active engagement with this critical environmental issue that is understandable for all ages and that works as an educational method for teachers in any country with NASA data.</div>

Our goal is to raise awareness about the harsh reality of climate change and how it is transforming our environment. We believe that by visualizing data in an impactful way, we can raise awareness and motivate action to protect our planet.</div>
